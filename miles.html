            <br>
        I say "fuck it" when I feel it<br>
        'Cause no-one's keeping tally, I do what I want with who I like<br>
        I ain't gon' conceal it<br>
        While you talking all that shit, I'll be getting mine, getting mine<br>
        Don't apologize for my behavior<br>
        If you're offended, I don't care (yeah)<br>
        Staring at me 'stead of staring in the mirror<br>
        Little weird how<br>
        Everybody tells me to play nice<br>
        Everybody judge, but looking twice<br>
        But my body don't belong to, nah-ah-ah, none of them though<br>
        And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so<br>
        I say "fuck it" when I feel it<br>
        'Cause no-one's keeping tally, I do what I want with who I like<br>
        I ain't gon' conceal it<br>
        While you talking all that shit, I'll be getting mine, getting mine<br>
        Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it<br>
        'Cause no-one's keeping tally, I do what I want with who I like<br>
        And I ain't gon' conceal it<br>
        I'll just do it like the boys say, I'm getting mine, getting mine<br>
        Told me to play it cool, I break the rules, I'm breaking hearts in two<br>
        Warned me to make the rules, or play the fool, it ain't that hard to choose<br>
        Take apart the "do"'s and "don't"s, and lose the "won't"s, I'm getting mine<br>
        Mines is mine, yours is mine, this is mine, get in line<br>
        Sometimes, I like to go play dirty<br>
        Just like all of the fuck boys do<br>
        That's my choice and there's no one I'm hurting<br>
        When that's not girly<br>
        Everybody tells me to play nice<br>
        Everybody judge, but looking twice<br>
        But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though<br>
        And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so<br>
        I say "fuck it" when I feel it<br>
        'Cause no-one's keeping tally, I do what I want with who I like<br>
        I ain't gon' conceal it<br>
        While you talking all that shit, I'll be getting mine, getting mine<br>
        Yeah, I say "fuck it" when I feel it<br>
        'Cause no-one's keeping tally, I do what I want with who I like<br>
